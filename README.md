# Advanced ToDo

Advanced ToDo is a project I recently completed as part of my journey to learn Node.js and Express.js. This project is my attempt to create an advanced to-do list, inspired by the functionality of Google Calendar.

## Project Overview

The project allows users to perform various CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their to-do tasks. The key features include:

- **Task Management:** Add, view, update, and delete tasks seamlessly.
- **Calendar View:** An intuitive calendar interface to organize tasks by date.
- **Motivational Section:** Receive a random motivational quote each time the website is loaded.
